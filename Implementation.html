      <h2 align="center" class="w3-wide">Best Practices</h2>
      <p>Businesses cannot follow a haphazard approach when implementing instant messaging into their daily workflows.
        Otherwise, the issues relating to privacy, security and productivity may be detrimental to businesses’
        operations. </p>

      <p>Here are some best practices that businesses should adhere to:</p>

      <ul type="circle" class="w3-left-align">
        <li>Adopt tools that are already familiar to employees to ensure more seamless
          integration.</li>
        <li>Establish ground rules that minimize distractions and mental health concerns.
        </li>
        <li>Clearly define protocols to deal with these issues if they arise.</li>
        <li>Encourage face-to-face communication by hosting events or using video
          conferencing.</li>
        <li>Respect the work/life balance of employees (to comply with legal requirements
          and to allow employees time to relax so that they can work more effectively).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can watch this interview about the legality around instant messaging in businesses:</p>

      <h2 align="center" class="w3-wide">Security Issues</h2>
      <p>Another important point to consider when integrating instant messaging into a business is security.</p>

      <figure align="center">
        <img src="IMAGES/Hinderence.png" width="60%" height="60%"
          alt="Bar graph showing how hindered people will be without instant messaging, compared to how often they use it.">
        <figcaption><b>Figure 1</b>: How hindered people will be without instant messaging, compared to how often they
          use it</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Although most people feel that they would be significantly hindered if they were not able to use instant
        messaging to do their jobs (see above), people also feel that instant messaging applications are generally not
        very secure. The average security rating by survey respondents was 3,64 out of 5 (you can download the results
        of that survey <a href="RESOURCES/IM_Survey_Analysis.xlsx" download>here</a>). This is concerning, as many
        sensitive documents are shared over instant messaging during
        collaboration. For these reasons, businesses should be very careful when selecting an application for their
        organisation to use. Some are proven to be much more secure than others.
      </p>

      <p>If businesses follow these best practices, the implementation of instant messaging applications is more likely
        to yield favourable results. </p>
