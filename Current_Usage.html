      <p>Instant messaging (IM) is already widely used in many businesses. It has been proven to have an overwhelmingly
        positive impact on communication quality and trust within teams (<cite>Ou & Davison, 2010</cite> ). This tool
        plays a crucial
        role in developing trust and promoting interactivity among team members, ultimately leading to improved teamwork
        and collaboration. With numerous instant messaging platforms for businesses to choose from, including both paid
        and free options, businesses can choose a platform that best suits their needs.</p>

      <p>Research indicates that most users are content with their instant messaging applications. The average
        satisfaction rating of survey respondents was 4 out of 5. The average rating of paid IM apps on the App Store is
        4,6 out of 5 stars, while free apps average a rating of 4,2 stars. However, some free options such as Signal and
        Microsoft Teams outperform their paid counterparts with ratings of 4,8 stars. This shows that any business can
        benefit from the advantages of IM, without any capital investment.</p>

        <figcaption><b>Figure 1</b>: How frequently people experience issues with instant messaging</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Although some users still experience issues with instant messaging applications (see above), these issues are
        experienced by less than 50% of users. However, businesses should still be aware of them. Common issues include
        connectivity problems and load shedding affecting communication. </p>

      <p>Despite the differences between instant messaging platforms, they all share these general advantages and
        disadvantages:</p>

      <table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
        <caption class="w3-padding-16" style="caption-side:bottom"><b>Table 1</b>: Advantages and disadvantages of instant messaging</caption>
        <tr>
          <th>Advantages</th>
          <th>Disadvantages</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Instant delivery of messages</td>
          <td>Both parties need accounts on the same messaging service</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Messages tend to be brief and to the point, especially compared to email</td>
          <td>Security and privacy can be compromised</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Real-time conversation allows for collaboration between co-workers, even in different locations</td>
          <td>Pop-up notifications can be intrusive and distracting, decreasing productivity</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>Expanding on the above table, research has shown that the idea that instant messaging drastically decreases
        productivity is a misconception (<cite>Ou & Davison, 2010</cite> ). You can read more about that study on
        <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282781192_The_impact_of_instant_messaging_in_the_workplace">www.researchgate.net</a>. The remarkable benefits such as instant delivery of messages and real-time collaboration
        opportunities outweigh the security, privacy, and productivity concerns in most cases. That is why instant
        messaging currently has a predominantly positive impact on businesses and should continue to be embraced.</p>
