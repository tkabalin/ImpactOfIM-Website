      <p>Although instant messaging is already widely used in businesses and is proven to have a positive impact,
        certain new technologies and innovations are certain to enhance this impact even further. </p>

      <p>The integration of AI (artificial intelligence) into messaging applications is a significant development,
        enabling users to engage with AI alongside humans. This can reduce the reliance of businesses on human resources
        for tasks such as customer service, as AI can handle general inquiries (<cite>Fokina, 2022</cite> ). </p>

      <p>AI chatbots have already been implemented to reduce customer wait times and allow businesses to handle large
        volumes of support requests. Integrating these automated systems into a business would relieve the workload of
        customer support agents, allowing them to handle more complex inquiries which have been escalated by the
        chatbots. For these reasons, AI is set to revolutionise the way businesses interact with customers over instant
        messaging. </p>

      </figure>

      <p>Additionally, business-focused instant messaging platforms like WhatsApp Business, which allow businesses to
        communicate directly with their clients, will see immense growth over the coming years (see above). This
        year-on-year growth in spending shows how much faith businesses have in this tool, as well as others like it.
      </p>

      <p>Finally, businesses need to remember that other communication methods still have their place (<cite>Kumar,
          2019</cite> ). Email, for instance, remains widely utilized as it facilitates messages to large groups, albeit
        with potential drawbacks such as its susceptibility to spam and malware. Furthermore, in urgent situations,
        phone calls remain the optimal choice.</p>

      <p>These innovations, and others that are yet to be developed, are sure to have an overwhelmingly positive impact
        on communication with customers and clients.</p>
